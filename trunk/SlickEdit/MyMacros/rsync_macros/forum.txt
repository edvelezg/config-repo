Good day,

I'm trying check if a path has the following string:
[code]
    "lin64vm458"
[/code]

For example the function would return true for the following path:
[code]
    "C:\tibco\lin64vm200\lin64vm458\abc\defg\"
[/code]

Is there a builtin function I can use for this? Or does anyone have a 
snippet that returns true if it has that string? 


I have set up mirror folders between a unix and windows machine and I'm trying to build
the unix path based on its windows equivalent, this is what I have so far. If anyone
knows a better way to do this at least for joining the paths.. let me know


[code]
    _command void copy_unix_path() name_info(','VSARG2_READ_ONLY|VSARG2_REQUIRES_EDITORCTL)
    {
    _str machineName, unixHome;
    int status = LoadRsyncIniFile(machineName, unixHome);

	    /* Get the directory name and file name */
    _str dirName = _strip_filename(p_buf_name,'N');
    _str filName = _strip_filename(p_buf_name,'P');

    _str windHome = 'C:\' :+ machineName :+ '\qa\';
    _str relaPath = substr(dirName, windHome._length());
    relaPath = stranslate(relaPath, '/',   '\');
    _str fullPath = unixHome :+ relaPath;

    _copy_text_to_clipboard(fullPath :+ filName);
    // _copy_text_to_clipboard(_strip_filename(p_buf_name,'PE'));
    }
[/code]

Thanks,
Ted

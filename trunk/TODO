Thesis
Need to create a section explaining the Correlation separate from the actual bitmap index stuff.
Need to rerun scripts and regenerate plots with daniel's fix of the Java code.
I need to add more content
short text on the behavior of runcount with correlation
Run new correlation measure on experiments
Attempt experiment with other column cardinalities
Do some experiments with different column cardinalities

NN
What if we have more than one output, how many slopes do we have then. Do we have one slope for each output?
I need to propose to dale to explain to me in a simple neural network. How we can express it in a differential equation.
AGHH THERE'S AN ERROR IN THE NETWORK.RB FOR ALL THE ARCTANS.
What am I supposed to do with flat slopes.. 
Add support for different neuron functions at different layers in the back-propagation code.


Ruby
Need to finish implementing my timer script.
I need to finish building my script that copies to mirror file on server and then executes the updated code.
Create a command called propagate that will distribute a copy of a file into a bunch of directories

CS course

Bash 
I am putting the the ssh agent stuff in the .bashrc file, but it 
seems like it is not touched at all after running the .bash_profile file, 
It is quite perplexing.  

I need to add my .Profile from my mac to the repository.  I have an idea 
of keeping the directory structures in svn configuration repo..  and then 
importing those folders on the operating system..  so that nothing bad may 
 happen 


I probably should mention that the measure correlation depends on the size 
of the sample as seen in the experiments that we did

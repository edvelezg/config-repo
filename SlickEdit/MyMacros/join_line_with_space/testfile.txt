Overly long unformatted statements present fellow editors a dilemma: spend excessive time
parsing out what a writer means or being mildly rude in not actually reading what is
written.  It is more collegial and collaborative to take an extra few moments to distill
one's thoughts into bite size pieces.  Traditionally, the phrase too long; didn't read
(abbreviated tl;dr or simply tldr) has been used on the Internet as a reply to an
excessively long statement.  It indicates that the reader did not actually read the
statement due to its undue length.[2] This essay especially considers the term as used in
Wikipedia discussions, and examines methods of fixing the problem when found in article
content.
